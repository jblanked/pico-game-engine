# pico-game-engine
A custom game engine for the Raspberry Pi Pico.

This project was inspired by [Pico-GB](https://github.com/YouMakeTech/Pico-GB) and the [Flipper Zero Game Engine](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-game-engine). It handles user input from both the joystick and push buttons, compresses and renders sprites (16-bit BMP, bytearray, and string), manages collisions between entities, and more.
